# generator-aowp-marionette

> [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator


## Getting Started

### What is Yeoman?

Trick question. It's not a thing. It's this guy:

![](http://i.imgur.com/JHaAlBJ.png)

Basically, he wears a top hat, lives in your computer, and waits for you to tell him what kind of application you wish to create.

Not every new computer comes with a Yeoman pre-installed. He lives in the [npm](https://npmjs.org) package repository. You only have to ask for him once, then he packs up and moves into your hard drive. *Make sure you clean up, he likes new and shiny things.*

```bash
npm install -g yo
```

### Yeoman Generators

Yeoman travels light. He didn't pack any generators when he moved in. You can think of a generator like a plug-in. You get to choose what type of application you wish to create, such as a Backbone application or even a Chrome extension.

To install generator-aowp-marionette from npm, run:

```bash
npm install git+ssh://git@innersource.accenture.com:aowp/generator-aowp-marionette.git
```

Finally, initiate the generator:

```bash
yo aowp-marionette
```

### Getting To Know Yeoman

Yeoman has a heart of gold. He's a person with feelings and opinions, but he's very easy to work with. If you think he's too opinionated, he can be easily convinced.

If you'd like to get to know Yeoman better and meet some of his friends, [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) and [Bower](http://bower.io), check out the complete [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/wiki/Getting-Started).

 - aowp-marionette:itemview
 - aowp-marionette:collectionview
 - aowp-marionerre:router
 - aowp-marionette:controller
 - aowp-marionette:crud

### Model
Model is generated via command: 

`yo aowp-marionette:model <model-name> --directory <folder-name>`

Generated file structure:

```
 <folder-name> 
      |- <model-name>-model.js
      |- <model-name>-model-test.js
```
### Collection

`yo aowp-marionette:collection <collection-name> --directory <folder-name> --model <model-name>`

This command will generate only collection and collection test and it uses specified existed model.

Generated file structure:

```
 <folder-name> 
      |- <collection-name>-collection.js
      |- <collection-name>-collection-test.js
```

If you want to create also model to this collection, use the command: 

`yo aowp-marionette:collection <collection-name> --directory <folder-name>`

Generating collection with this command will cause also generating new model and its test. 

Generated file structure: 

```
 <folder-name> 
      |- <collection-name>-collection.js
      |- <collection-name>-collection-test.js
      |- <model-name>-model.js
```

`yo aowp-marionette:itemview <item-view-name> --directory <folder-name>`

Generated file structure: 

```
 <folder-name>

      |- <item-view-name>-item-view-test.js
      |- <item-view-name>-template.hbs
```
### Collection View

`yo aowp-marionette:collectionview <collection-view-name> --directory <folder-name> --childview <item-view-name>`

This command wil generate only collection-view and its test. As a child view there will be used specified item view.This command will generate also new item view as a child view.

Generated file structure: 

```
 <folder-name> 
      |- <collection-view-name>-collection-view.js
      |- <collection-view-name>-collection-view-test.js
```

Collection view can be also generated by command: 

`yo aowp-marionette:collectionview <collection-view-name> --directory <folder-name>`

This command will generate also new item view as a child view.

Generated file structure: 

```
 <folder-name> 
      |- <collection-view-name>-collection-view.js
      |- <collection-view-name>-collection-view-test.js
      |- <item-view-name>-item-view.js
      |- <item-view-name>-item-view-test.js
